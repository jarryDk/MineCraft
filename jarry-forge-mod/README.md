##Forge Development kit

Get the sourcecode from [files.minecraftforge.net](http://files.minecraftforge.net/minecraftforge/1.8)

Unzip the sourcecode and navigate to the folder. On my computer this is /home/michael/MineCraft/Forge/forge-1.8-11.14.0.1295-1.8-src

[michael@localhost forge-1.8-11.14.0.1295-1.8-src]$ cd /home/michael/MineCraft/Forge/forge-1.8-11.14.0.1295-1.8-src

[michael@localhost forge-1.8-11.14.0.1295-1.8-src]$ chmod +x gradlew

The next task is going to take some time +5 min

[michael@localhost forge-1.8-11.14.0.1295-1.8-src]$ ./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace

[michael@localhost forge-1.8-11.14.0.1295-1.8-src]$ ./gradlew eclipse

Time to download [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) - just pick Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.

Launch Eclipse and select /home/michael/MineCraft/Forge/forge-1.8-11.14.0.1295-1.8-src/eclipse as workspace.
